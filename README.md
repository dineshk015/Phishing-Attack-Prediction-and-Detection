Phishing URL Detection Using Machine Learning 

This project presents a machine learning–based approach for detecting phishing URLs by analyzing URL patterns, HTML features, and other structural attributes. The system compares the effectiveness of multiple algorithms and identifies the best-performing model for phishing prediction. This work is part of a Phase-1 academic project focusing on literature survey, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model comparison, and workflow design.
